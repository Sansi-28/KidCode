# --- Pull Request Review Settings ---
reviews:
  # When 'true', CodeRabbit will automatically review new pull requests.
  # If 'false', you must manually trigger reviews with the "@coderabbitai review" command.
  enabled: true

  # The message "Auto reviews are disabled on base/target branches other than the default branch"
  # is a common default setting. If you want CodeRabbit to review pull requests
  # targeting branches other than 'main' or 'master', you may need to configure it here
  # or in the CodeRabbit UI. The following is a common way to do it.
  # (Uncomment and adjust to your needs)
  #
  # branches:
  #  include:
  #    - "main"
  #    - "develop"
  #    - "feature/**" # Reviews PRs from any feature branch

  # Disable the status message mentioned in your log.
  # When 'true', CodeRabbit posts a status message like "Review skipped...".
  # Setting this to 'false' will stop those messages from appearing.
  review_status: false

  # You can exclude certain files or directories from being reviewed.
  # This is useful for documentation, test data, or generated files.
  paths:
    exclude:
      - "**/*.md"              # Exclude all Markdown files
      - "**/test_scripts/**"    # Exclude all example scripts
      - ".coderabbit.yaml"      # Exclude the config file itself
      - "Dockerfile"

# --- Command Settings ---
# Configure which "@coderabbitai" commands are available in PR comments.
commands:
  # Allow manual reviews to be triggered by commenting "@coderabbitai review" on a PR.
  # This is useful even if automatic reviews are enabled.
