#  Code of Conduct

## üëã Introduction

Welcome to the **KidCode Visual Interpreter** community! üé® KidCode is an educational programming language designed to teach coding fundamentals through visual, interactive learning with our friendly turtle "Cody." As an educational project that aims to inspire young minds and make programming accessible to learners of all ages, we are committed to fostering a supportive, inclusive, and encouraging environment.

Our community includes educators, students, parents, developers, and anyone passionate about making programming education fun and accessible. We believe that learning should be joyful, collaborative, and free from barriers that might discourage participation.
